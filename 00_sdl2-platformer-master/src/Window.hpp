/// The main (and only) window of the program.
///
/// Wraps low-level SDL video functions that interfaces with the
/// Operational System's Window Manager.
///
/// Here we set things like fullscreen, window position, size, etc.
///
/// @note Most of these functions may fail horribly depending
///       on the OS! Do not rely on them too much.
///       The ones that may fail have their descriptions started
///       with _Tries to_.
///
/// ## For developers
///
/// This class also deals with framerates and frame delay.
/// Here's an explanation on how it does it:
///
/// The FPS on a powerful machine is fast and the FPS is slow
/// on a poor computer.
///
/// If on our code we have a movement like this:
///
///     Player.x += 1;
///
/// Then it will move 30 pixels per second on a machine with
/// 30 FPS and 60 pixels per second on a machine with 60 FPS
/// (slow and fast machines, respectivelly).
///
/// Now if we have a movement like this:
///
///     Player.x += 45 * dt;
///
/// Then the player will move 45 pixels per second INDEPENDENT
/// of the machine's FPS.
///
/// That's because if *dt* is the ammount of seconds since last
/// frame, if we keep doing this every frame:
///
///     float var += 1 * dt;
///
/// Then after 1 second the variable will have 1 INDEPENDENT
/// of the machine's FPS.
///
/// THAT's what those `frame_*` variables at
/// the end of `Window` does.
///

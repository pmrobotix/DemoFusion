/// Abstract definition of a game state.
///
/// ## For dummies
///
/// A game state is a certain well-defined way the game behaves.
///
/// Like the main menu (a state), for example. From there,
/// the player can start the actual game (another state) and,
/// show the pause menu (even another state).
///
/// Examples include the game over screen, high score screen,
/// cutscenes, etc.
///
/// ## For developers
///
/// All the other game states inherit from this baby.
/// Each one must implement at least four methods - *load()*,
/// *unload()*, *update()* and *render()*.
///
/// Each state controls the game flow via return values of
/// the *update()* method. If, for instance, the player dies
/// during the game, it should return *GAME_OVER* or *QUIT*.
///
/// A state can also comunicate with the next one by returning
/// a value from *unload()*. That value will be passed on the
/// next state's *load()* and it should know what to do with it.
///
class GameState
{
public:
    /// All possible transitions between states.
    ///
    /// They are used to change from one state to the other.
    /// The current state returns this at *update()* and the
    /// *StateManager* makes the appropriate changes.
